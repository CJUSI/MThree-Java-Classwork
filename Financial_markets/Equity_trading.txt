    -Restricted stock - shares that can only be traded under SEC regulations.
    -Floating stock - shares currently available to trade.
  -Market cap is publicly available information. Companies are ranked in size - large cap, mid cap, small cap.
    -Large cap stocks are referred to as blue chip companies.

Dividends:-
  -Dividends are a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings - decided by the board of directors (can be cash or stock). These are
   typically paid twice a year (4 in US).
  -Investors invest in companies for two main reasons:
    -The Capital Value.
    -The Dividend Value.
  -Dividends are issued on a per share basis.
  -Why pay dividends:-
    -If a company has 1000 shares outstanding and a share price of $2, its market cap is $2000.
    -If this company has $10,000 in the bank, then in theory, it could be bought for $2000 and liquidated, giving an $8000 profit to the new owner.
     The company would prefer the issue dividends to promote the stock and reduce the amount of cash on the balance sheet vs their MCap.
