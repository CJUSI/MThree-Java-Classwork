Course Objectives:
  -Describe the characteristics of a relational database.
  -Explain the purposes of normalization, including reasons for denormalizing a database.
  -Read and create an ERD that represents a relational database.
  -Normalize a database to third normal form.
  -Use SQL to perform CRUD operations on a dataset, including creating new data, retrieving existing data, updating existing data, and deleting data, using a variety of parameters.
  -Use SQL to create a database based on an existing ERD, including the use of appropriate data types for different kinds of data.
  -Use SQL to add data to a database from an existing dataset.
  -Use SQL to perform calculations on data in a database.
  -Create views and subqueries.
  -Discuss data optimization techniques for relational databases.


--What is a Database--
  -Give examples of commonly-used databases.
  -Distinguish between data and information.
  -Compare relational databases with non-relational databases.
  -Explain the relationship between a database and a database management system (DBMS).
  -Define components of a relational database.

Database:-
  -Backend System architecture to allow a developer to store data externally (server) to be accessed from multiple frontend sources.
  -Usually not accessible by the user directly.
  -Structured representation of data that can be read and written from.

Database Uses:-
  -Computer Games
  -Learning Management Systems
  -Smartphones and applications
  -Healthcare systems
  -Schools and University Systems

Data vs Information:-
  - Data = Raw individual facts - often meaningless without context.
  - Information = Processed data - with context, logically grouped and analysed according to requirements or use case.

Structured vs Unstructured databases:-
  - Structured = Data is organised in a specific pattern, controls what data is available, accessible and stored.
    The type of data stored is usually limited to preserve and improve data integrity (reliability and accuracy).
    Mostly used with predictable data such as bank accounts, driving licences etc.
  - Unstructured = Data contains some structure but without strict controls. Often faster than structured databases but
    data integrity is compromised by duplicate or redundant data.  Used mostly with unpredictable data, such as social
    media posts, reviews and other user generated content.

Database vs. DBMS (+Relational DBMS):-
  - DBMS = Software system that manages multiple databases.  Can execute commands, provide security, network access
    and admin tools for DB Administrators (DBAs) to work with DB files.
  - RDBMS Options:
    -MySQL
    -PostgreSQL
    -Microsoft SQL Server
    -Oracle Databse
    -DB2
  - Choice of DBMS determines some factors of how the data is organised but they mostly do the same thing.

Relational Database Concepts:-
  - Created with the goal of reducing duplicate data and making it easier to retrieve and manage specific data.
  - Highly Structured organised into tables (relations) where each table represents a logical group of data.
  - Row = Horizontal layer of cells holding facts about 1 discrete thing - known as a record (tuple). 
  - Column = vertical strip of cells holding the same type of data but each fact is for a different thing/state.
    Also called, field, attribute, of one data type/size/shape.
  - Cell = Intersection of row and column, holds one fact about one thing - a single piece of data.
